# Zeus Philosophy

Zeus is a wager on three convictions:

1. **Liveness beats latency.** Instant feedback changes how we reason
   about programs. By keeping the entire system malleable we invite
   exploration and make refactoring a continuous act.
2. **Purity empowers empathy.** Strong semantics build trust. When side
   effects are explicit and types tell the truth, we can collaborate with
   the runtime and with other developers more effectively.
3. **Tooling is language design.** Debuggers, editors, and visualizers
   shape the way we think. Zeus treats tools as peers to the compiler;
   they share the same introspection fabric and can reconfigure the
   language while it runs.

We value playfulness, transparency, and composability. The goal is not a
perfect language on the first try, but a platform where ideas can be
prototyped, measured, and evolved quickly.
