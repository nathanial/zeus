### 9. Metrics & Monitoring Dashboard
Real-time system and application metrics visualization.
- **Needed features**: Time-series data handling, charting library, alerting, WebSockets
- **Example**: `(plot-metric cpu-usage time-range) (alert-when (> value threshold))`
- **Value**: Monitoring is essential for production systems

### 10. Code Review Tool
Web interface for reviewing code changes with inline comments.
- **Needed features**: Diff algorithms, syntax highlighting, comment threads, notifications
- **Example**: `(render-diff old-file new-file) (add-comment line-number text)`
- **Value**: Code review is integral to team development

## Command Line Utilities

### 11. File Synchronization Tool
Sync files between local and remote locations with conflict resolution.
- **Needed features**: File system watching, SSH/FTP clients, diff algorithms, scheduling
- **Example**: `(sync-folders local-path remote-path (on-conflict 'prompt))`
- **Value**: Developers constantly sync code and data

### 12. Build System & Task Runner
Flexible build tool for compiling, testing, and deploying projects.
- **Needed features**: Process management, dependency resolution, parallel execution, caching
- **Example**: `(define-task 'build (deps 'compile 'test) (run "cargo build"))`
- **Value**: Every project needs build automation

### 13. Environment Manager
Manage development environments, dependencies, and configurations.
- **Needed features**: Process isolation, environment variables, package management, virtualization
- **Example**: `(create-env "project-env" (packages rust node python))`
- **Value**: Managing multiple project environments is challenging

### 14. Data Migration Tool
ETL utility for moving data between databases and formats.
- **Needed features**: Multiple database drivers, data transformation, validation, progress tracking
- **Example**: `(migrate-data source-db target-db (transform-fn record))`
- **Value**: Data migration is a common DevOps task

### 15. Template Generator
Scaffold new projects and generate boilerplate code.
- **Needed features**: Template engine, interactive prompts, file operations, git integration
- **Example**: `(generate-project "web-api" (options database 'postgres auth 'jwt))`
- **Value**: Reduces setup time for new projects

### 16. Performance Profiler
Analyze and optimize Zeus/LISP program performance.
- **Needed features**: Execution tracing, memory profiling, call graphs, report generation
- **Example**: `(profile-function 'my-func) (generate-flamegraph trace-data)`
- **Value**: Performance optimization requires good tooling

## Core Features Needed for These Apps

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (CLI Tools)
Start with command-line utilities to establish core features:
- File I/O and process management
- Basic networking (HTTP client)
- JSON parsing
- Build a simple task runner or file sync tool

### Phase 2: Web Capabilities
Add web application support:
- HTTP server framework
- WebSocket support
- Database connectivity
- Build a simple REST API or dashboard

### Phase 3: GUI Applications
Integrate GUI capabilities:
- Choose and bind a GUI toolkit (Qt, GTK, or web view)
- Event handling system
- Build a database browser or log viewer

### Phase 4: Polish & Performance
Optimize for production use:
- Performance profiling tools
- Better error handling
- Package management
- Documentation generation

## Success Metrics

An app is considered successful if it:
1. Solves a real developer problem
2. Is performant enough for daily use
3. Has better ergonomics than shell scripting
4. Demonstrates Zeus's unique strengths
5. Can be extended by users

## Next Steps

1. Choose 1-2 CLI utilities as proof of concept
2. Implement minimal file I/O and process features
3. Build and dogfood the tools
4. Gather feedback and iterate
5. Gradually add features for more complex applications
